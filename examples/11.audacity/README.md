# Digital Audio With Audacity

Example of using Audacity to produce multi-track audio. Key concepts include:

- Recording audio tracks from a microphone.
- Importing sound effect files into tracks.
- Using the Selection tool to edit parts of the audio.
- Using the Zoom tool to zoom in or out (click while holding the `Shift` key).
- Using the Time Shift tool to move selected parts of the audio forward or backward in time.
- Using the Envelope tool to create smooth volume shifts to tracks.
- Reducing background noise with the Noise Reduction effect.
- Evening sound levels with the Normalization effect.
- Other effects, including Distortion, Echo, and Pitch Shift.
- Export to MP3 using the bundled [LAME MP3 encoder](https://lame.sourceforge.io/).
